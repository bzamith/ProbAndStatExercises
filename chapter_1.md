# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

## Section 1.1 - What is Statistics?

### Q1) Classify as True or False each of the following statements:
**a) Statistics is a set of techniques used to organize a set of numerical values.**
> FALSE. Statistics handles more than numeric values, such as categorical ones. Also, it not only organizes but also makes inferences and performs more complex tasks.

**b) Every time that we are working with numbers, we should use Statistical Inference.**
> FALSE. We can also use Descriptive Statistics and Probability fields of study. Also, if the data refers to the entire population, it doesn't make sense to use Statistical Inference.

**c) Descriptive Statistics provides a correct approach to handling a set of values, numerical or not, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon of interest.**
> TRUE.

**d) Any sample represents, in an adequate manner, a population.**
> FALSE. If we don't select a correct sampling approach, it may not be representative of the population.

**e) Statistical techniques are not adequate for cases that involve destructive experiments, such as burning down equipment, destruction of proof bodies, etc.**
> FALSE. The statistical techniques are especially useful in cases where the object of study is damaged after experimentation, as they minimize the number of units that will be analyzed.

### Q2) For the situations described below, identify the population and the corresponding sample. Discuss the validity of the statistical inference process for each case.

**a) To assess the effectiveness of a vaccination campaign in the State of São Paulo, 200 mothers of newborns, during the first semester of a given year and in a specific maternity hospital in São Paulo, were interviewed regarding the last time they vaccinated their children.**
> Population: All mothers of newborns in the state of São Paulo
> Sample: 200 mothers from a single maternity hospital
> Validity: Mothers from different maternity hospitals should have been interviewed to avoid bias related to the chosen maternity hospital in the study. Otherwise, it cannot be claimed that the sample is representative of the population.

**b) A blood sample was taken from a patient suspected of having anemia.**
> Population: All the blood of the patient
> Sample: A blood sample
> Validity: The sample has the potential to be representative of the population if collected in a sufficient quantity, given that it is homogeneous in the entire body.

**c) To assess the viewership of a television program, 563 individuals were interviewed by phone regarding the channel they were tuned to.**
> Population: All individuals who watch television in Brazil
> Sample: 563 individuals
> Validity: Requiring that the interviewed people have telephones may be segregating in the sense that it is only selecting people from higher incomes, those who have access to this technology.

**d) In order to evaluate the voting intention for the president of Brazilians, 122 people were interviewed in Brasilia.**
> Population: All voters in Brazil
> Sample: 122 voters from Brasilia
> Validity: Doesn't seem to be representative, given the low number of interviewees and the bias related to the fact that only one city was included in the survey.

### Q3) Discuss, for each of the cases below, the precautions that need to be taken to ensure a good conclusion from the sample.

**a) A group of children will be chosen to receive a new meningitis vaccine.**
> It is important to ensure that the chosen group is diverse in terms of age, health conditions, and other relevant factors. Random sampling can help avoid bias and ensure a more representative sample.

**b) We randomly selected a certain number of housewives to test a new laundry detergent.**
> Care should be taken to ensure that the selected housewives represent a variety of demographics, such as age, location, and laundry habits. This helps in generalizing the results to a broader population of potential consumers.

**c) A factory wants to know if its cookie production tastes as expected.**
> The sampling process should include a variety of batches to account for potential variations in production. Randomly selecting samples from different production runs can help ensure a more accurate assessment of the overall product taste.

**d) Popular acceptance of a government project.**
> It's crucial to ensure a diverse representation of the population in the sample to avoid bias. Factors such as geographical location, age groups, and socio-economic backgrounds should be considered to capture a more comprehensive view of public opinion.
